/*!
 * This is the interface for a number of modules that use or transform data.
 *
 * They must implement open(), close(), read() and write() in  a standard
 * manner. They  must check and return errors, and set errno appropriately if
 * not set by the called party.
 *
 * They are completely defined at construction or just after, as the open()
 * method must not require any arguments.
 *
 * The read() and write() methods must get or put exactly the given number of
 * bytes, except of course when read reaches the end of the stream.
 *
 * The close() method should report an error if any previous call failed.
 *
 * The path() method tries to return the path to the underlying stream, if any.
 * Otherwise it must return NULL.
 *
 * The offset() method tries to return the offset of the underlying stream, if
 * any. Otherwise it must return -1.
