These tools can help your development as they help mine.
I personally just copy them into /usr/local/bin...

hcolor:     a colorizing wrapper for any program
hmake:      a more colorful make, using hcolor or colormake (if found)
svn-tkdiff: calls tkdiff recursively on files modified in Subversion

Enjoy!
