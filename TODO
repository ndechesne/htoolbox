TODO - non-organised list of things I want to do
  * test 'no space left on device' somehow
  * zero copy on Line assignment
  * sort out getLine(Line&)
  * sort out owner/list architecture
  * save remote client config locally
  * report activity via web pages
  * user management (list of users for each client, from server's users...)
  * restoration via web gui
