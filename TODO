TODO - non-organised list of things I want to do
  * test 'no space left on device' somehow
  * sort out list interface further
  * sort out lists management the right way
  * restoration via web gui
  * handle all compression requirements (maybe 1.2)
  * backup's backups (1.2)
  * review files.h (Directory to speed up) (1.1)
  * test copy/compare/stackhelper/multiwriter/nullwriter/share (all tested elsewhere though)
