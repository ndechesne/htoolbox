<h1>Parsers</h1>

<h2>Introduction</h2>

<p>Parsers are there to save time when dealing with files under version
control, typically source code and documents.</p>

<p>Version control systems are used to keep track of changes on files deemed
important to the project. It is this notion that parsers rely on. Indeed, if files deemed important are under version control, then those that are not
controlled are therefore not considered important.</p>

<p>On the other hand, files that are under version control and have not been
modified need not necessarily be backed up, as they are already backed up on
the version control server, at least for centralised version control
systems.</p>

<h2>Syntax</h2>

<p><code>parser &lt;parser name&gt; &lt;type&gt;</code></p>

<h2>Parsers</h2>

<p>The parsers available are as follows:</p>
<table border="1" width="100%">
  <tr>
    <td><b>Parser name</b></td>
    <td><b>Description</b></td>
    <td><b>Comment</b></td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>cvs</td>
    <td>Parser for the CVS version control tool</td>
    <td>This parser uses the times in the CVS entries file to decide whether a
      file is modified or not.</td>
  </tr>
</table>

<h2>Types</h2>

<p>To try and suit all cases, the following parser types have been devised:</p>
<table border="1">
  <tr>
    <td><b>Parser type</b></td>
    <td><b>Description</b></td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>controlled</td>
    <td>Backs up all files under version control</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>modified</td>
    <td>Backs up files under version control that are locally modified</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>others</td>
    <td>Backs up all files that are not under version control</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>local</td>
    <td>Backs up all files that are not under version control, or are locally
      modified (= <i>modified</i> + <i>others</i>)</td>
  </tr>
</table>

<p>Note: only the initial of the type matters, so <code>modified</code> can be
replaced by <code>m</code> or <code>mod</code> or <code>mamma</code> without
any change in behaviour.</p>

<h2>Example</h2>

<p><code>parser cvs modified</code></p>
