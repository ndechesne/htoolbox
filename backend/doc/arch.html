<h1>HBackend architecture</h1>

<h2>Introduction</h2>

<p>This document is an attempt at defining the architecture for the backend of my backup system.</p>

<h2>Description</h2>

<p>The aim of this backend is to allow for easier concurrent access to the backup database as well as background tasks. The backend will be an always-on daemon which shall provide the necessary scripts to integrate with the latest fashion of init (system V, upstart and systemd). It will require root privileges for mouting remote shares.</p>

<h2>Layer</h2>

<p>This backend will work at the data management layer and will have no clue about file metadata.</p>

<h2>Methods</h2>

<p>The <code>name()</code> method returns the path where to find the data given a reference.</p>

<p>The <code>write()</code> method is only given a file path to read from, and returns a status and a reference to the file contents (in fact a hash of the file), which is garanteed to be composed of only digits (0-9) and letters (a-f) and to be no longer than 256 characters in length.</p>

<p>The <code>read()</code> method takes a reference as argument and writes a new file at the given path containing the data stored under that reference.</p>

<p>The <code>remove()</code> method takes a reference and removes it and its associated data from the database.</p>

<p>The <code>crawl()</code> method triggers a full database check and returns the references found as it goes.</p>

<h2>Interface</h2>

<p>This backend will be accessible using an internet socket (local access only). The RPC protocol is based on TLV (tag, length, value).</p>
