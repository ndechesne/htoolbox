.SH DESCRIPTION
.PP
.B hbackup
backs up directories from local and remote storage.

The files are backed up in a way that does not depend on the backup
storage filesystem, and that prevents data duplication. The system
keeps track of changes in metadata too, such as permissions, owner,
group and modification time.
