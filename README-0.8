This is very important, so lease read carefully, and do not hesitate to contact
me in case of doubt at <herve@lucidia.net>.

If you are upgrading an existing DB from 0.7 to 0.8 and have two clients with the
same name, one using the  file or nfs protocol, and the other using the smb
protocol, please read this file till the end.

CONVERTING THE SERVER CONFIGURATION FILE

I All clients use different names:

Replace lines like:
  client smb client1
  (...)

By two lines like:
  client client1
  protocol smb
  (...)

II Two clients have the same name, one UNIX (file, nfs) the other WINDOWS (smb):

The smb client needs a subset name, which will be 2 by default (set by the
automatic list converter).

Replace lines like:
  client smb client1
  (...)
  client nfs client1
  (...)

By two lines like:
  client client1 2
  protocol smb
  (...)
  client nfs client1
  protocol nfs
  (...)

Note the string '2' following client1 in the smb case.
