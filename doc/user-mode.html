<h1>User-mode backup</h1>

<p>User-mode backup is a special case of backup. It does not require a
server-side configuration, but has some requirements.</p>

<h2>Database</h2>

<p>The database will be created in the <code>$HOME/.hbackup</code> directory,
so you <b>must</b> leave it free for that use.</p>

<h2>Configuration file</h2>

<p>The configuration file is a standard <a href="client.html">client-side</a>
configuration file, except that paths starting in <code>~</code> are
allowed, where <code>~</code> represents the <code>$HOME</code> path as
defined in the current environment.</p>

<p>The configuration file <b>must</b> be
<code>$HOME/.hbackup/config</code>.</p>

<p>There is no need for a specific filter to ignore the
<code>~/.hbackup</code> path, as directories named <code>.hbackup</code>
are always ignored.</p>
