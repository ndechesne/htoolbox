<h1>Parsers</h1>

<h2>Introduction</h2>

<p>Parsers are there to save time when dealing with files under version
control, typically source code and documents from industry projects.</p>

<p>Version control systems are used to keep track of changes on files deemed
important to the project. It is this notion that parsers rely on. Indeed, if files deemed important are under version control, then those that are not
controlled are therefore not considered important.</p>

<p>On the other hand, files that are under version control and have not been
modified need to necessarily be backed up, as they are already backed up on
the version control server, at least for centralised version control
systems.</p>

<p>To try and suit all cases, the following parser types have been devised:</p>
<table border="1">
  <tr>
    <td><b>Parser type</b></td>
    <td><b>Description</b></td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>controlled</td>
    <td>Backs up all files under version control</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>modified</td>
    <td>Backs up files under version control that are locally modified</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>others</td>
    <td>Backs up all files that are not under version control</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>local</td>
    <td>Backs up all files that are not under version control, or are locally
      modified (= <i>modified</i> + <i>others</i>)</td>
  </tr>
</table>

<p>The parsers available are as follows:</p>
<table border="1" width="100%">
  <tr>
    <td><b>Parser name</b></td>
    <td><b>Description</b></td>
    <td><b>Comment</b></td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>cvs</td>
    <td>Parser for the CVS version control tool</td>
    <td>As the parser cannot check whether the files are modified ot not,
      <i>modified</i> is the same as <i>controlled</i>, and <i>local</i> is
      the same as having no parser at all</td>
  </tr>
</table>
