<h1>HBackup documentation</h1>

<h2>Introduction</h2>

<p>This is a backup program. The name HBackup has been chosen because of the way data is stored: based on the file hash (&agrave; la git).</p>

<p>Why yet another backup program? Because I wanted something geared towards
what I do: software development. This system can easily be made to recognise
version-controlled directories to optimise backup choices: why re-backup files
that are on a server somewhere, itself with its own backup system?</p>
